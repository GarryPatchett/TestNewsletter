Our 2014 grant round has now closed for applications, and final decisions on the projects we’ll be funding will be made in the summer.
Funding decisions will be made by two expert panels of researchers, scientists and people affected by MS. These panels will consider all aspects of the application itself and how well it fits with our Research Strategy and James Lind Alliance (JLA) Priorities.

You can read more about the grant round process on the research blog on our [website](http://www.mssociety.org.uk/ms-support/practical-and-financial-help/work-and-money/grants "MS Society Grants").

#### New projects funded in 2013

From our 2013 grant round we’ve committed funding to 18 new projects, totalling £2.1 million. This takes our total spend on research since 1956 to £148 million (in today’s money).Research into progressive MS is a priority area, and this is reflected in the new projects funded. Many studies are focused on ways to repair damage to myelin, while other interesting new projects aim to develop treatments for foot drop, bladder symptoms and chronic leg swelling.
