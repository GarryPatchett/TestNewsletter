# Branch News

#### Caravan
It was agreed that any savings made resulting from the disposal of the caravan should go towards providing grants by the branch and helping towards any costs for short term breaks or holidays and also organising social events.
#### Speakers
Les will make enquiries regarding costs and availability of speakers on various subjects for future branch meetings.
Benefits Awareness talk
It was suggested that there might be a Benefits Awareness talk in the Tyne & Wear area based possibly at the Quality Hotel, Boldon. We are awaiting confirmation of this from the Sunderland branch who would be hosting it.
#### Derek Johnston
Derek has informed us of his decision to cease his membership of the branch from April and with it his position as a Committee Member dealing with fundraising.
This is because of personal commitments. Our thanks extend to Derek for all of his excellent work for the branch and its members.
#### Dave Farham
Dave has informed us of his decision to stand down from his position as Chairman after serving for a number of years in this role and also in various other positions on the committee over his 30+ years as a member of the branch.
However Dave remains a much valued committee member assuming the role of Social Secretary.
