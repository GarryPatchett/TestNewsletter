# Branch Annual Meeting
### Date: April 2nd, 2014

The evening began at 6.30 P.M on the 2nd of April 2014, with refreshments and the annual meeting opened at approximately 6.45 P.M.

The Chairman opened the meeting, welcomed those attending (total of 17 members) and gave a report of the preceding yearâ€™s activities.

The Chairman thanked all of the branch officers, committee members, branch members and fundraisers for their hard work and support. The Treasurer gave a brief financial report and statement of accounts.

Most existing committee members were happy to stand for election again for the next year. Nominations were taken from the floor, which were in turn seconded. Votes were then taken by a show of hands, and by a simple majority the new committee was elected. You can see the committee on their page later in this magazine.

It was agreed that we should continue to seek volunteers to fill the positions of Chairman, Website Editor and Fundraising Officer.
Voting was followed by a discussion about future branch spending plans regarding the following:

* Grants for short breaks/holidays/respite care.
* Jointly part funding a Benefits Awareness talk with Sunderland branch.
* Speakers for future meetings/proposed various branch social events/proposed "thank you evening" for all our fundraisers over the past year.
* Possible purchase of a suitcase ramp to assist with access at social events.

Further refreshments were then served and the meeting closed at 7.45 P.M.
